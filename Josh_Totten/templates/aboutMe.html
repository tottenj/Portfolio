                I am a third year Computer Science major, currently working towards an Honours Bachelor of Computing at the 
                University of Guelph. I have studied many topics ranging from memory and microcomputers to systems and database 
                design. I am well versed in the programming languages C, Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Swift. I have 
                previous work experience at Hoffman La Roche as a Pharma Technical Supply (PTS) and Futureworks summer intern. 
                In this role I learned to use data visualization tools such as dashboards as well as had the opportunity to use 
                code to solve a variety of problems in an agile environment.

                My academic and job experiences have allowed me to develop valuable skills in collaboration, problem-solving, 
                and critical thinking. I have been recognized as a clear and concise communicator with the ability to interact 
                professionally and tactfully with co-workers, supervisors and customers. My hobbies include playing the drum kit, 
                enjoying various styles of music and creating extracurricular programming projects.
